#database

You can build and launch the database container with "source docker.txt" or copy and paste the commands into a cmd shell. This will start one mariadb (mysql) container and one phpadmin (optional) if you want to manage your database via web gui. 

Login to phpadmin and create the two tables from the create statements in the create_db.sql file
